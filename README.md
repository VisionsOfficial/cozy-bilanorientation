# Bilanorientation

## What's Bilanorientation?

Bilanorientation is a POC. There is no CI linked to this repository. If you need to deploy it, you need to build it and deploy it manually. 

Latest deployed branch: build/CustomJSONData

### Install

Hacking the Cozy Bilanorientation app requires you to [setup a dev environment][setup].

You can then clone the app repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/crash/bilanorientation.git
$ cd bilanorientation
$ yarn install
```

:pushpin: If you use a node environment wrapper like [nvm] or [ndenv], don't forget to set your local node version before doing a `yarn install`.

Cozy's apps use a standard set of _npm scripts_ to run common tasks, like watch, lint, test, buildâ€¦
